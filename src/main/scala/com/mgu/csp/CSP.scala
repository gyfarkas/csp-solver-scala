/**
 * This is the abstract representation of a CSP. A CSP is defined by a set of variables X_i (through
 * its initial assignment) and a set of constraints. It provides boolean accessors to determine whether
 * a given assignment is consistent or satisfied with its definition. A solution to the CSP is an
 * assignment that is both complete and satisfies all constraints.
